What is a Module?

A module is simply a separate python file (.py) that can contain functions and
data (variables)Modules can be imported into your application.

You can use a module to create code libraries you can use in multiple applications

Adding a Python file

You can use any name for your module file.

The important thing to remember is the module py file has to be in the same
directory as your python app.

There are ways to import custom modules from directories, but we won't cover them
